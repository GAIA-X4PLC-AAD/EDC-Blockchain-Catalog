# EDC Connector with Blockchain Support

This repository provides a samples implementation of a blockchain based catalog for the Eclipse Dataspace Components (EDC). This extension is developed and maintained at the Chair for [Information System Engineering](https://www.tu.berlin/ise) at the Technische UniversitÃ¤t Berlin in context of the [GAIA-X 4 Product Life Cycle - Arcoss Automated Driving](https://www.gaia-x4plcaad.info/) project.

> This repository is just one part of the infrastructure. To run the complete infrastructure, please refer to the [Main Repository](https://github.com/GAIA-X4PLC-AAD/edc-blockchain-broker)

This Repository holds the source code for the following components:
- blockchain-logger (logs agreement and transfer events to the blockchain)
- blockchain-catalog-api (provide a `/blockchaincatalog` endpoint to query the blockchain and retrieve a DCAT Catalog)
- blockchain-catalog-listener (listen to edc specific events and requests and trigger the [EDC-Blockchain-Interface](https://github.com/GAIA-X4PLC-AAD/EDC-Blockchain-Interface) to store and retrieve data on the blockchain)
- transfer/http-push (is used for transfer demonstration purposes)
